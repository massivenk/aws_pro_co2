Security Token Service (STS)

  Identity Federation :  use of external Idp to gramt access to AWS. Options Corporate Identity and Web Identity federation
  Cross-Account access:  Provide access to other AWS accounts define user in one account and use those identities to access aws resources in another aws account 
  Instance Profile    :  Provide EC2 instance and hosted application to AWS resources via an attached role

Assuming a Role 
  uses STS a global service API request
  provides temporary credentials which consist of :  Access Key ID , secret access key and security token
  Additional optional parameters can be added to futher secure the AssumeRole request
           DurationSeconds     - time duration default is 1 hour supported for upto 12 hours
           Policy              -  permission inline 
           PolicyArns.member.N - managed policy which should exist in the same account as the role
           Tags.memeber.N      - session tags that you want to pass with the role
           SerialNumber and TokenCode - include MFA information

Managing Role Sessions
  all users assumeing the role have the same permissions
  role session permission  further restrict overall permissions
  identity-based policies and resource-based policies , further restrict the  assume role permissions providing Effective Permissions

Federated Users
  Authenticated AWS account through other identity provider
  Identity federation is system of trust between two parties for authentication
  IdP responsible for authentication
  Service Provider (AWS) responsible for authorization
  Open Identity Standards [ SMAL 2.0 , OIDC and OAuth 2.0 ]

IAM Identity Center  [ SSO using external IdP ]
    Steps (Authenthication and Authorization)
    AssumeRole with permissions policy need to exist in the AWS for access to resources
       A user in your organization uses a client app to request authentication from your organization's IdP.
       The IdP authenticates the user against your organization's identity store.
       The IdP constructs a SAML assertion with information about the user and sends the assertion to the client app.
       The client app calls the AWS STS AssumeRoleWithSAML API, passing the ARN of the SAML provider, the ARN of the role to assume, and the SAML assertion from IdP.
       The API response to the client app includes temporary security credentials.
       The client app uses the temporary security credentials to call Amazon S3 API operations (resource).
