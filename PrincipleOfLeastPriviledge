Principle of Least Priviledge
      Grant access as needed
      Separation of duties
      Avoid long-term credentials

IAM request Context  :  three main pieces of logic that define what is in the policy and how the policy actually works leading to authentication and authorization
         Principal (subject) -  user , role , external users , application /service that sends a request with a  policy associated with the principal
         Action    (verb)   - what the principal is attempting to do
         Resource  (object) -  object which the actions or operations are performed
   Identity-Based Policy a document (json) which is associated with the subject detailing the permissions.  Evaluation of the documents are done when request has been made
        Three types of documents (policies)
             AWS Managed
             Customer Managed
             Inline
   Policies (documents) also have conditions associated to the actions : condition has operators
         String  : StringsEquals [exact match case sensitive] , StringNotEquals [Negated matching] , StringsEqualsIgnoreCase [exact match ignore case] , StingLike
         Numeric
         Date and  time
         Boolean
         Binary
         Ip Address
         Amazon resource name - for some services
         IfExist
         Null check
  Policy types
         identity-based policy
         resource-based policy
         organisation service control policy
         iam boundary policy
         access control list 
         session policies
   Guardrails  : used to restrict permissions
         SCP , Permissions Boundary , Session Policies
   Grants : used to grant access
         Identity-based , Resource-based , ACL 

 Permissions rules within an account , requires SCP and Identity-based policy and/or resource-based policy
            for cross account permissions you require SCP and Identity policy , identity policy and resource-based policy

Presence of an SCP , IAM permissions boundary and Session policy can overide an allow with an implicit deny
Differentiate between role-based and attribute-based access controls pillar
